## Introduction

- A pathfinding visualization tool for demonstrating pathfinding algorithms in action.
- Angular Framework serves as the foundation for this project.
- This project is inspired by [@clementmihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu)

## Demo

## Features

- 2D board

  - Draw custom walls using the mouse
  - Drag the start and target cells to new positions
  - Responsive board with animations
  - Traverse in four directions
  - Show the visited cells while exploring the board

- Search Algorithms

  - A\* Algorithm 
  - Breadth-First Search
  - Depth-First Search
  - Dijkstra\'s Algorithm
  - Greedy Best-First Search

- Maze Generation Algorithms

  - Basic Random Method
  - Recursive Division Method

- Prevent unexpected interactions by restricting user inputs during different phases (maze generation, searching).
