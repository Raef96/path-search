## Introduction

- A pathfinding visualization tool for demonstrating pathfinding algorithms in action.
- This project is inspired by [@clementmihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu) after watching his YouTube video ([Cl√©ment Mihailescu's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4t_-NjY_Sg)) on pathfinding visualization.
- This is my personal attempt at creating a pathfinding visualization tool.

## Demo

## Features

- [x] 2D board

  - [x] Draw custom walls using the mouse
  - [x] Drag the start and target cells to new positions
  - [x] Responsive board with animations
  - [x] Traverse in four directions
  - [x] Show the visited cells while exploring the board
  - [ ] Add lines to clearly indicate path taken

- [x] Search Algorithms

  - [x] A\* Algorithm 
  - [x] Breadth-First Search
  - [x] Depth-First Search
  - [x] Dijkstra\'s Algorithm
  - [x] Greedy Best-First Search

- [x] Maze Generation Algorithms

  - [x] Basic Random Method
  - [x] Recursive Division Method

- [x] Prevent unintended interactions by restricting user inputs during different phases.
